                           <p class = "titledesc">In our digital world, information flow is often the measure of success and fully informed population. GIS can facilitate this information flow in many forms and is increasingly relied upon in the municipal environment for this purpose. The main vehicle for information flow from a GIS is through the map application environment. These environments can facilitate many use cases for a municipal system (Govpilot, 2017). Organizations often have centralized models where GIS access is only in the hands of highly specialized and trained individuals. However, the City of Richmond Hill wished to decentralize and develop basic map making/viewing capabilities among all staff regardless of whether they are regular GIS users or not. The GIS group for Richmond Hill had done some preliminary work to conceptualize some of their future products and services. When the project began, they had developed skeletal prototypes and proof-of-concepts to show the basic capabilities of Esri’s internal web GIS applications. By implementing an advanced printing tool, ArcGIS Hub, and web maps this allowed the City of Richmond hill to see how they can leverage more functionality of ArcGIS Enterprise solutions and allow easy access to GIS for all users both non-GIS and GIS staff.</p>              
                           <p class = "titledesc">The client for this project was the City of Richmond Hill. The representatives for this project were Praful Mistry (Manager of GIS Solutions), Dan Harrietha (GIS Services), Todd Kroeplin (GIS Services), Danny Bainbridge (GIS Services), and Abhinay Arora (GIS Services). All the clients were contacted via email (firstname.lastname@richmondhill.ca) or the City of Richmond Hill at 905-771-8800.</p>                     
                           <p class = "titledesc">The problem Beaver Solutions addressed was that the City of Richmond Hill’s staff had basic map creation and data viewer capabilities. However, their continued reliance on outdated technology was problematic because their current system is no longer under maintenance and so support is now gone or otherwise very limited which puts the whole system at risk. In addition, time constrains caused them to be slower to implement modern ArcGIS Enterprise solutions, which was causing them to miss out on the automation capabilities that the Esri products can provide.</p>

                     <h1><strong>Project Description</strong></h1>   
                        <p class = "titledesc">The City of Richmond Hill is currently using outdated technology for their Geographic Information Systems (GIS) applications. This project was to enable the city to implement the latest features and functionality of the applications and tools created by Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc., (Esri) for Aeronautical Reconnaissance Coverage GIS (ArcGIS). This demonstrated technology that their internal users could use to view data and produce simple maps. The development took place on the Beaver Solutions systems which is not an exact duplicate of the software versions and system requirements of Richmond Hill. Due to the incompatibilities between the two systems, the deliverables submitted were various forms of documentation, scripting, and sample solutions for the city to implement on their own server.</p>              
                        <p class = "titledesc">There are various technologies from Esri that are available to improve data viewing and printing capabilities. However, displayed data requires a high level of quality control. For this project, the water, storm and sanitary databases were analyzed for optimization, structure and data integrity before well-designed cartographic outputs were created. All this preprocessing was necessary to achieve the main objective. Three solutions were prototyped to meet the objective of creating maps using a dynamic template: Application Programming Interface (API) using ArcGIS Server, Experience Builder and ArcGIS Hub. For dynamic printing, hosting printing geoprocessing services on ArcGIS Server was recommended to increase customization capabilities and enhance security. The self-serve mapping interface was accessible via ArcGIS Hub. To the best of the team’s ability the deliverables attempted to encompass everything the city will need to replicate the solutions on their own system. This project highlighted what the City of Richmond Hill could do with their Esri platform to meet their current business needs and highlighted some future functionality that could help to enhance the proof-of-concept prototypes developed by Beaver Solutions.</p>
