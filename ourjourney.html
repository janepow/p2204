                           <p>Throughout this process, there were a total of three web maps that were created to be put into both the HTML code and also the ArcGIS Hub. Each of these web maps were created using ArcGIS Pro and then shared on AGOL. By demonstrating how web maps can interact with the printing tool geoprocessing service in a variety of both custom-built and pre-fabricated platforms, the client was able to see it's versatility. Web app builder was avoided as it will be phasing out within the next couple of years, and all future functionalities will be transitioning into experience builder. It was recommended to the client that they grow that applications functionality rather than using an expiring platform. </p>

Throughout the process of this documentation, step by step processes were recorded throughout every week to ensure easy implementation for the client. Mistakes, problems encountered, recommendations for implementation on their own systems, and helpful links were also provided.</p>
